                    Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact foods
                    on Earth. To lower your diet's footprint, consider transitioning to a vegan
                    diet, or at least eating more vegan meals. Along with this, it's important to focus on wasting less
                    food.

                <td>
                    Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like vegetable peels,
                    avocado pits, and spoiled leftovers) to landfill, start composting. Composting
                    is the process of returning anything that comes from nature to the earth, and letting it biodegrade
                    into soil. Setting up a compost bin is super easy if you have a backyard, but it's also possible if
                    you live in an apartment or in a city with no yard.
